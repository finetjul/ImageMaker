QuickTools
==========

Slicer extension of useful modules for the Slicer developer.
QuickTools intends to be a placeholder for small modules that can be handy when developing and debugging on Slicer.

The modules are general (e.g. not particuliar to a medical domain), small (typically a CLI module) and with no extra dependency (i.e. the same ones as Slicer). 

Anyone is welcome to add new modules to this extension by forking and creating pull requests.
